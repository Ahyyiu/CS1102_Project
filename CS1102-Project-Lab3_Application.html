        <li> <div id="main"><div id="box1">Automated inspection and quality control</div></li>
        <p1>Image classification can be used to automatically inspect products on an assembly line, and identify those that do not meet quality standards.

        <li><div id="box1">
            <div id="main">Detection of cancer cells in pathology slides</li> </div>
            <p2>Dermatologists examine thousands of skin conditions looking for malignant tumor cells. Using image classification can reduce time to identify the case.

        <li><div id="box1"><div id="main">Security</li></div>
        <p3><br>Surveillance: It can help in automatically identifying and categorizing objects in surveillance footage. This can help security personnel detect and respond to potential threats more quickly.</br>
            Facial recognition: It can also help authorities identify people of interest in crowds. Image classification can help the security sector leverage computer vision technology in areas such as banks, airports, and other crowded places.

            <div id="main">land use mapping</li></div>
        <p4>Image classification can be used to automatically map land use, for example, to identify areas of forest or farmland. There, it can also be used to monitor environmental change, for example, to detect deforestation or urbanization, or for yield estimation in agriculture use cases.</p4>
