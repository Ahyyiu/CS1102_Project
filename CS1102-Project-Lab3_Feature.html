        <ol>
           <li>Data collection</li>
            <p1>The dataset stored in image classification should be large in size and represent the sample of images that cover a large number of categories that is going to be classified.Ensuring the quality and higher diversity level is important as it directly affects the performance of the model. 
            </p1>
            <li>Feature extraction</li>
            <p2>This process is to identify visual patterns in an image that distinguish one object from another. It increases the performance of machine learning models by focusing on the most related and crucial areas of data.
            </p2>
            <li>Transfer learning</li>
            <p3>Transfer learning is a neural network model that learns how to solve a problem beforehand. Therefore,they can solve similar problems more easily. This can reduce the training time and decrease the chance of having errors.
