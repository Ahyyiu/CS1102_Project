        <h3>Main features and function</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Data collection</li>
            <p1>Data collection is one of the most important steps in developing an automated image classifier model. Ensuring the quality and diversity level of the training data is crucial since they directly impact the performance of the model. The dataset should be large-scale and representative of the sample of images that cover the complete range of categories to be classified.</p1>
            <li>Feature extraction</li>
            <p2>Feature extraction is a substantial process in image classification for identifying visual patterns within an image that will be used to distinguish one object from another. The patterns are typically exclusive to the specific class of images which results in distinct class differentiation. It enhances machine learning models' performance by focusing on the most relevant and important aspects of data.</p2>
            <li>Transfer learning</li>
            <p3> transfer learning is a technique whereby a neural network model is first trained on a problem similar to the problem that is being solved. Transfer learning can reduce the training time for a learning model and lower generalization error. </p3>
