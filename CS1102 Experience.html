<h1>Experience</h1>
The project could enhance the experience of programming. Throughout the project, we are facing severals challenges such as understanding the codes and using them effectively.
Moreover, this project could enable us to organizing webpages and classifying images.

<h2>Result</h2>
<p1>In The first part of the code extracts a dataset from a zip file, retrieves the file paths and class labels, and organizes them in a DataFrame. It thenalso provides information about the dataset's size, number of classes, and the count of images in each class.
</p1>

<p2>The second part uses the train_test_split function to divide the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets. It then assigns the file paths and class labels to each set and prints the sizes of the sets for reference
</p2>

<p3>The third part creates ImageDataGenerator objects for training, validation, and testing. These objects are configured with specific parameters for data augmentation, batch sizes, and other settings. They are used to flow data from the DataFrames, providing augmented training data and non-augmented validation and testing data in batches.

<p4>The fourth part builds and trains a model using the EfficientNetB5 architecture with pre-trained weights. It fine-tunes the model by unfreezing and training the last few layers. The model is compiled with appropriate settings, and a learning rate scheduler is used to adjust the learning rate during training.

<p5>In the next section, the trained model will be evaluated on the test set, and the test loss and accuracy will be printed. Additionally, the training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs will be plotted, with a focus on highlighting the epochs with the lowest validation loss and the highest validation accuracy.

<p6>>Following that, the trained model will be evaluated on the training, validation, and test sets using the respective generators. The evaluation results, including the loss and accuracy for each set, will be printed.
</p6>

<p7>In the seventh section, predictions will be generated using the trained model, and a confusion matrix will be computed and plotted using matplotlib. The confusion matrix provides insights into the model's performance, displaying the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each class. 
</p7>

<p8>By using the classification_report function from sklearn.metrics, the report is printed to the console, displaying the metrics for each class in a tabular format.
</p8>

<p9>Lastly, the code saves the trained model to an HDF5 file, loads the model from the saved file, defines a function to predict and display the class label of an image using the loaded model, and demonstrates the prediction by calling the function with a test image.
