<h1>Experience</h1>
    NG Ho Yin:
 <p1>In this project, I learned about deep learning and using computers to determine what emotions pets feel based on their faces. I used special computer programs called TensorFlow and Keras to help me. I aimed to create a computer model to tell if a pet looked angry, happy, sad, or some other emotion. This project was significant for me because I don't program in Python very often. I started by gathering pictures of pets' faces and organizing them. Then, I used a model program that was already trained to recognize faces and adapted it to work with pet faces.
<br>
One of the things I learned from this project was how to use a special kind of technology called machine learning. I learned that it's really important to adjust specific settings to make the machine learning work best. I also learned to look at charts and reports to see how well the machine learning is doing. The project also taught me that it's not just about using the technology but also understanding how to interpret and show others how well it's working. I learned how to make charts and reports that show the good and not-so-good parts of machine learning. I also learned how to save and use machine learning in other things we might make in the future.
<br>
Looking back on what I did, I learned that studying real projects helps me understand ideas better. Working on dealing with data, creating models, and checking how well they worked made me better at solving problems step by step and more confident in my programming skills. I want to tell others to try doing projects like this, too. They can use the code I used to learn about deep learning. If they change and add to it, they can learn even more and feel proud of making models that actually work.

        In this project, I have learnt to create a webpage and informations about image classification.
<br>
In the past, I have no idea about what image classification was. This project gave me a chance to obtain related information by searching the internet. It was surprising to know that image classification involves many complex process and techniques. Moreover, it has been applied in our daily life for a long time ,for example it helps people to detect the specific object that appear in the camera by highlighting it. This project made me broaden my horizons and get more interested in digital technologies.
<br>
There were some problems that I have faced when I was doing a programme. I tired to make use of the techniques that have taught in the lectures. When I tested the program, some contents could not show it on the webpage .I felt upset at that time. However, I tried to check the code to see whether there was a mistake or not. This experience made me wonder that I have to be careful when typing programs.

    CHOI Ming Chueng:
<p3>
    In this project, I learned about using deep learning and computer programs like TensorFlow to identify human emotions based on facial expressions. My goal was to create a computer model that could recognize emotions such as anger, happiness, and sadness. This project was important to me because I don't often program in Python. I started by collecting and organizing pictures of human faces, and then adapted a pre-trained model for face recognition to specifically work with human emotions.
<br>
In the middle of the project, I realized that machine learning is the most important element to it. It is because it can adjust the specific setting to make us get the most accurate result. I acquired the knowledge of analyzing charts and reports to assess the performance of machine learning. This project underscored the significance of not just using the technology, but also effectively conveying and interpreting its efficacy to others. I developed the ability to produce visual representations that showcase both the achievements and areas for enhancement in machine learning. Furthermore, I gained the expertise to store and implement machine learning in upcoming projects.
