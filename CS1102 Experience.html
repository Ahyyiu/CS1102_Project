<h1>Experience</h1>
NG Ho Yin:In this project, I learned about deep learning and using computers to determine what emotions pets feel based on their faces. I used special computer programs called TensorFlow and Keras to help me. I aimed to create a computer model to tell if a pet looked angry, happy, sad, or some other emotion. This project was significant for me because I don't program in Python very often. I started by gathering pictures of pets' faces and organizing them. Then, I used a model program that was already trained to recognize faces and adapted it to work with pet faces.
<br>
One of the things I learned from this project was how to use a special kind of technology called machine learning. I learned that it's really important to adjust specific settings to make the machine learning work best. I also learned to look at charts and reports to see how well the machine learning is doing. The project also taught me that it's not just about using the technology but also understanding how to interpret and show others how well it's working. I learned how to make charts and reports that show the good and not-so-good parts of machine learning. I also learned how to save and use machine learning in other things we might make in the future.
<br>
Looking back on what I did, I learned that studying real projects helps me understand ideas better. Working on dealing with data, creating models, and checking how well they worked made me better at solving problems step by step and more confident in my programming skills. I want to tell others to try doing projects like this, too. They can use the code I used to learn about deep learning. If they change and add to it, they can learn even more and feel proud of making models that actually work.
