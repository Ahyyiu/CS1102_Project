             <br>What is image classification?<br>
        <p1>Image classification is a technique that analyzes the content of an image to attach tags or labels to it. This distributes the images into different classes. The purpose is to digitally explain the contents of the image to a machine. Image classification is combined with image localization to enable an object detection system to find objects in images.

        <br>Typs of image classification<br>
        <p2>
            <ol>
                <li>Single-label image classification</li>
                It is a traditional image classification, where each image is linked with only one label or class. For example, an image of a cat can be labeled as cat and other things that appear in the image are not label.The task is to anticipate the label for a given image.
                <li>Multi-label image classification</li>
                It is an extension of the single-label image classification, where multiple labels or classes are linked in the image. For example, an image about a cat playing in a park can be labeled as cat and park. The task can anticipate all the relevant labels or classes for a given image.
                <li>Hierarchical classification</li>
                It organizes classes into a hierarchical structure according to their similarities, where the class in a higher-level represents broader categories while lower-level class is more particular and specific.

        <br>Purpose of image classification<br>
        <p3>Since the cameras and sensors obtain a great deal of unstructured image data
            , people use advanced techniques like machine learning algorithms to examine the images more efficiently. Image classification plays a vital part in digital image analysis. It is based on AI-based deep learning models to analyze images and get the result for specific tasks that already exceed humans.
