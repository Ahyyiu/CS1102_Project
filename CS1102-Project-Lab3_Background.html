        <h3>What is image classification?</h3>
        <p1>Image classification is a technique that analyzes the content of an image to attach tags or labels to it. 
            This distributes the images into different classes. The purpose is to digitally explain the contents of the image to 
            a machine. Image classification is combined with image localization to enable an object detection system to find objects
             in images. </p1>
             
        <h4>Typs of image classification</h4>
        <p2>
            <ol>
                <li>Single-label image classification</li>
                A traditional image classification problem where each image is associated with only one label or class. For example, an image of a cat can be labeled as cat and nothing is labeled.The task of the classifier is to predict the label for a given image.
                <li>Multi-label image classification</li>
                An extension of the single-label image classification problem, where an image can have multiple labels or classes associated with it. For example, an image of a cat playing in a park can be labeled as cat and park. The task of the classifier can  predict all the relevant labels or classes for a given image.
                <li>Hierarchical classification</li>
                It is the task of organizing classes into a hierarchical structure based on their similarities, where a higher-level class represents broader categories and a lower-level class is more concrete and specific. 

            </ol>

        <h5>Purpose of image classification</h5>
        <p3>Since the vast amount of image data obtained from cameras and sensors is unstructured, we use advanced techniques such as machine learning algorithms to analyze the images efficiently. Image classification is probably the most important part of digital image analysis. It uses AI-based deep learning models to analyze images with results that for specific tasks already surpass human-level accuracy .</p3>
