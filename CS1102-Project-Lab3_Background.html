             <br>What is image classification?<br>
        <p1>Image classification is a technique that examines an image and labels it. It arranges the image into different categories . The aim is to allow the machine to learn the characteristics of the image. It combines with image localization so that the system can detect objects in images.

        <br>Types of image classification<br>
        <p2>
            <ol>
                <li>Single-label image classification</li>
               Each image is associated with only one label or class. For example, a cat playing in a park is shown in the photo and it only labels cats. Other things in the photo do not have tags. The task is to predict the label of an image.
                
                <li>Multi-label image classification</li>
                An image can have multiple labels or classes associated with it. For example, the same photo showing a cat playing in a park have two labels : cat and park. The task of the classifier can  predict all the relevant labels or classes for a given image.
                
                <li>Hierarchical classification</li>
                It organizes classes into a hierarchical structure according to their similarities, where the class in a higher-level represents broader categories while lower-level class is more particular and specific.

        </p2>
        <br>Purpose of image classification<br>
        <p3>Since the cameras and sensors obtain a great deal of unstructured image data
            , people use advanced techniques like machine learning algorithms to examine the images more efficiently. Image classification plays a vital part in digital image analysis. It is based on AI-based deep learning models to analyze images and get the result for specific tasks that already exceed humans.
